# BARK Marketplace (Proof of Concept)

Welcome to the BARK Marketplace, a proof of concept demonstration showcasing the initial implementation and functionality of our e-commerce platform. This section serves as an introduction to the marketplace, highlighting its architecture, supported payment gateways, and usage instructions.

## Architecture

The BARK Marketplace consists of two main components:

1. **Backend:** Handles server-side operations, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and integration with payment gateways.
2. **Storefront:** Provides the user interface for browsing products, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing purchases.

## Payment Gateways

The BARK Marketplace supports the following payment gateways:

1. **Solana Pay:** Enables users to make payments using Solana blockchain technology, offering secure and efficient transactions.
2. **Stripe:** Integrates with traditional payment methods, providing flexibility and accessibility for users.

## Usage

To set up and run the BARK Marketplace locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Similarly, navigate to the `storefront` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd storefront
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Once dependencies are installed, you can start the backend and storefront servers to run the marketplace locally.
